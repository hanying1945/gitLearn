Honey,
Today is sunny on April 2nd.If I'm not mistaken,you went out with another girl yesterday.Just the two of you.
i am sorry i can not accept you hang out with another female.You could say i am selfish.
Actually,I really do believe that love is exclusive and Something that cannot be shared with others. 
There was a time when I even thought you shouldn't exercise, work, or engage in social activities like normal, and instead, spend all of your time with me.
perhaps my love is horrible.So,I made a decision for you, which is to leave me.Only by doing so can you escape from a person who loves you in a pathological way.
God knows how much I miss you and how much I need you.
Perhaps one day I can have a healthy and normal love, but not now.
I have a bit of stomach ache.

"No matter how mediocre I may be, I always feel that my love for you is beautiful. Let me tell you, every time I think of you, a smile appears on my ugly face. 
I give my entire soul to you, along with its quirks, tantrums, indecisiveness, 1,800 bad habits—it's truly annoying, but it has one good thing, 
which is loving you."
